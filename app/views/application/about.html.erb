<div id = "documentation" class="code" style="max-width:700px">

<p>	
	Welcome to Swarm Combat! This is the attempt of two passionate game designers to revive the innovation and creativity that used to define digital games, with a genre-breaking game.
</p>
<p>
	Swarm Combat encourages players to plan ahead, think logically, and account for multiple scenarios, instead of focusing on reflexes, button-mashing or timing puzzles. Mostly because we love games, but kind of suck at those things ;)
</p>
<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>
	In Swarm Combat, you get to design a battle strategy for your 'drones' which then duke it out in a battle field against another player. 
</p>
<p>
	You get to do this using a strategizing GUI (that starts to spookily resemble programming) to list out what actions to take under different circumstances.
</p>
<p>
	Use concepts from Real-Time Strategy games to determine optimal tactics for attacking and surviving: For example, one such as pulling back weakened units and bringing them back to fight when they aren't being targetted.
</p>
<p>
	Don't worry about not knowing how to play, <%= link_to "Just jump right in!", root_url %> We're sure you'll figure it out.
<p>
<h1>Coming Soon</h1>
<p>
	Swarm Combat is currently in the running for <a href="https://gameon.mozilla.org/en-US/entries/swarm-combat/">The Mozilla Game On Contest</a>. We have to freeze our code for the duration of judging, but here are the next steps that we've laid the groundwork for!
